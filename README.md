## Usage instructions

### GitHub Pages Site

Please visit the GitHub Pages [site](https://srikur.github.io/nussinov-viz/) for this project in order to use the web application. There are no dependencies or installations required, other than having Javascript enabled in your browser.

### Inputting Sequences

The web application accepts an RNA sequence as input, and only allows for the capital letters "A", "U", "C", and "G" to be input. Any other character will not be accepted. Similarly, the hairpin loop length must be an integer, while the same applies for the graph paramters (in order for the graph to be properly generated).

### Modifying the Graph

The nodes on the force-directed graph visualization can be dragged, which often helps "detangle" structures. Please try this if you find that the predicted structure looks as if nodes or links are overlapping.
